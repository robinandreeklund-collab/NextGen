### Integration Verification

#### Execution Modes
- [x] **Simulation Mode** (`sim_test.py`)
  - 8 agents initialized
  - Voting mechanism active
  - Statistics displayed

- [x] **Demo Mode** (`start_demo.py`)
  - 8 agents initialized automatically
  - Simulated market data
  - All agents voting on each decision

- [x] **Live Mode** (`start_live.py`)
  - 8 agents initialized automatically
  - Live WebSocket data
  - All agents voting on each decision

#### Trading Loop Integration
- [x] Market data flow to agents
- [x] Indicator calculation (RSI, MACD, ATR)
- [x] Agent analysis triggering
- [x] Vote publishing to message_bus
- [x] Ensemble voting aggregation
- [x] Performance tracking
- [x] State management

#### Ensemble Voting System
- [x] Votes published to `decision_vote` topic
- [x] vote_engine receives agent votes
- [x] ensemble_coordinator aggregates with PPO/DQN/DT
- [x] Performance-based weighting
- [x] Final decision coordination

#### The 8 Agents (All Integrated)
- [x] 1. MomentumAgent - RSI momentum (>60 buy, <40 sell)
- [x] 2. MeanReversionAgent - Extreme reversals (RSI <30 buy, >70 sell)
- [x] 3. TrendFollowingAgent - MACD trends (>1.0 buy, <-1.0 sell)
- [x] 4. VolatilityAgent - High ATR (ATR>5 + RSI)
- [x] 5. BreakoutAgent - Technical breakouts (RSI+MACD combo)
- [x] 6. SwingAgent - Swing timing (RSI 40-60 + MACD)
- [x] 7. ArbitrageAgent - Price spikes (Â±2%)
- [x] 8. SentimentAgent - Analyst consensus
