    ✅ 102/103 total system tests pass (1 pre-existing failure unrelated to Sprint 4.4)
    ✅ Full integration with portfolio_manager, rl_controller, strategic_memory_engine, and introspection_panel validated
    ✅ Reward flow from portfolio → reward_tuner → rl_controller works correctly
    ✅ Parameter adjustment via MetaParameterAgent functional
    ✅ Logging and visualization operational
    ✅ Sprint 4.4 implementation complete and validated
